# Pong-game
Recreation of the famous game Pong

**Overview**

Pong is a table tennis type game, where a player is trying to hit or save the ball from going past their side (or end of the table as in table tennis). The player controls a "paddle" or in this case, a rectangular block, by moving it back and forth across the screen. The ball is moving around the screen and the object of the game is for the player to keep the ball from passing their paddle/block. They achieve this by positioning the block under the ball, and moving it to the next location of the ball. They can compete against the computer or another player (bonus feature). The goal will be for the player to reach 10 points/hits to move onto the next round. 

Round 1 will start off "easy" and subsequent rounds will get more difficult. Extra difficulty can occur in a few ways. 
  1) The player's paddle will get smaller
  2) The ball will move faster
  3) There could be more balls added (bonus feature)
